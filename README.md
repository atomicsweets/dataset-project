*Data 115*

# Motivation:
When starting this project, the initial thing that brought me to this topic was simply that I found it fascinating. The data was very clear and there was an abundance of it. Not only that but there was many questions that you could draw from the data at hand. Initially when I looked at it I had several questions come to mind. Because there are so many categories that affect the sales in different ways there was a lot to analyze. One such question I had was "does the platform affect game sales?" Another question I had was "Were some years more profitable?" This question could also lead to trying to figure out how that year was more profitable. This could be done by simply looking at the genre of the games or the platforms they were released on.  More or less with this question I was more keen on finding a way to be able to figure out why. I wanted to test to see if see if I could figure that out from the data I had.  To answer this question all I have to do is look at the raw data. This is because the data is already ranked. Now that might bring up a question of "then why are you focusing on this question?" Well, the reason I'm focusing on it is because of the why aspect that I aspect that I touched on previously. From this I was able to develop other questions including my big question. My big question is "which publisher has the most and highest sales?" Looking at the data you can probably make an assumption as to which publisher has the highest sales. No it's important to note that that is not just my big question as a whole. There are many little aspects to go into and to consider when looking at looking at who has the highest sales. Essentially my big question boils down to why the you're had the highest sale. What was the genre of the game? Could a publisher have a hand in it? What I mean by the question I just asked is, Did people buy the game because it was from a popular publisher? If nothing else is to be determined from answering the question, This could give some insight as it's very possible are you possible that people would buy from a popular publisher. This is because in the eyes of a gamer, They are a little more trustworthy. They have probably made a lot of fun games in the past. Because these are ranked by a single game and how well they did it makes the process a little easie
So the biggest things I ultimately ended up focusing on was the why aspect when it came to the best selling game. The genres and which of them was the most profitable. The publishers, to see which sold the most. Impossibly to look at it platform and see if that is an important factor. Once I have the genre and the publisher and possibly the platform data, I can determine why the most profitable game was in fact more profitable than the others.

# Data process: 
To start off the process of trying to answer my initial question, what I did was I opened up the raw data. Once I did that I inserted a pivot table, or rather opened one.

![Pivot Table options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91548816/145465881-1b36de6e-1059-4194-b125-8a8738708b81.PNG)

Once I did this I was able to simply check the Box I wanted and the global profit. For example, Selecting publishers and the global showed a table of the combined amounts for all the publishers.  Once I got everything separated into their own documentations I started to focus on the platform first.

## Platform Data

When it came to the platforms I knew that this specific aspect of the data probably wouldn't end up matching the first ranked game. Although the game that's at the very top Is on the Wii platform, as far as the sales go wii actually comes about 3rd in place of the highest. After doing some research, I found that the we actually came out in 2006 which is the year this year that this game is ranked. But it was not the most popular platform available. The wii is surpassed a little bit by the Xbox 360 and a lot by the playstation 2. These other two consoles were released prior to the wii. From what we can see with this part of the data. We can observe that the platform didn't necessarily have an effect as to why that game ranked number one.

## Publisher Data

I provided a snippet from the original data table. Out of the 3 main aspects of the data that I chose the analyze, This one definitely had the most data to look at. In the raw data there is a lot of different types of publishers that are tied to each game. What I wanted to see was if there was a relation between the best selling game and the publisher. The initial idea behind this was that nintendo was a very popular company so people might be more likely to buy a game from that company then something that may not have as big of an a name.  Since the best selling game is a nintendo game I compiled all of the publishers into a table will and was able to confirm that indeed nintendo had the highest sales. Although there were a few runner UPS most of the other publishers didn't have that high of a number.

I can conclude that the fact that the game was released under an nintendo title suggests that this may be one of the reasons why it sold so well. Indeed there is a correlation.

## Genre

 Data

Genres was by far the easiest out of all of the data points I picked to analyze. There was a small amount of genres, 13 to be exact.  Our best seller was listed as a sports title. Looking at the data you can see that sports is beat by the action genre. That doesn't mean that there's no correlation at all as sports is still very popular as you can tell from the data. The aspect that sports is by far the 2nd best in terms of this data, Shows that a sports title combined with a big name like nintendo can cause the game to sell a lot better than with other combinations of publishers and genres.

# Visualization

These 2 parts of the data are included into a graph to show A graphic version of the data I was observing. The reason I concluded these two and not publishers is because there was a lot more publishers than there was these. If I did publishers, I would have to have shortened it down significant. Ultimately it didn't feel necessary to add publishers as it was very clear that nintendo was the top of that data.  Also the important part about adding these 2 is their correlation with the best ranking game. With the publisher data nintendo ranked the top to the top so it hit my expectation. With these two data points however it doesn't do that. With console, The results I was focusing on ranked 3rd place. And the result I was looking at for genre was 2nd place.

Still that doesn't mean that the data is nullified and has nothing to do with why we sports ranked number one. In fact because these are all so high on their own rankings it tells us a lot about how the combination of these 3 very much had to do with its spot at number one.

So inconclusion I can say that that the genre the platform and the publisher did have something to do with the rank one for game sales.

# Analysis

While doing this analysis I very much made use of the cluster method when it came to separating my data and getting my results. There was a lot of different pieces of data that went into the original raw data. Not only that but there will be multiple of one. Since I needed a combined number for global sales and there was data that was listed under the same name, I needed to combine that data.

For example in platforms there was multiple different numbers for PC because there was multiple games that were on pc. I needed all of the ones that were PC games to be combined into one category so I could have 1 total amount.

The cluster method helped me calculate the density of these cells and separate them so I could come to my conclusions and solve my big question.
