# Motivation:
When starting this project, the initial thing that brought me to this topic was simply that I found it fascinating. The data was very clear and there was an abundance of it. Not only that but there was many questions that you could draw from the data at hand. Initially when I looked at it I had several questions come to mind. Because there are so many categories that affect the sales in different ways there was a lot to analyze. One such question I had was "does the platform affect game sales?" Another question I had was "Were some years more profitable?" This question could also lead to trying to figure out how that year was more profitable. This could be done by simply looking at the genre of the games or the platforms they were released on.  More or less with this question I was more keen on finding a way to be able to figure out why. I wanted to test to see if see if I could figure that out from the data I had.  To answer this question all I have to do is look at the raw data. This is because the data is already ranked. Now that might bring up a question of "then why are you focusing on this question?" Well, the reason I'm focusing on it is because of the why aspect that I aspect that I touched on previously. From this I was able to develop other questions including my big question. My big question is "which publisher has the most and highest sales?" Looking at the data you can probably make an assumption as to which publisher has the highest sales. No it's important to note that that is not just my big question as a whole. There are many little aspects to go into and to consider when looking at looking at who has the highest sales. Essentially my big question boils down to why the you're had the highest sale. What was the genre of the game? Could a publisher have a hand in it? What I mean by the question I just asked is, Did people buy the game because it was from a popular publisher? If nothing else is to be determined from answering the question, This could give some insight as it's very possible are you possible that people would buy from a popular publisher. This is because in the eyes of a gamer, They are a little more trustworthy. They have probably made a lot of fun games in the past. Because these are ranked by a single game and how well they did it makes the process a little easie
So the biggest things I ultimately ended up focusing on was the why aspect when it came to the best selling game. The genres and which of them was the most profitable. The publishers, to see which sold the most. Impossibly to look at it platform and see if that is an important factor. Once I have the genre and the publisher and possibly the platform data, I can determine why the most profitable game was in fact more profitable than the others.

# Data process: 
To start off the process of trying to answer my initial question, what I did was I opened up the raw data. Once I did that I inserted a pivot table, or rather opened one.

Once I did this I was able to simply check the Box I wanted and the global profit. For example, Selecting publishers and the global showed a table of the combined amounts for all the publishers.  Once I got everything separated into their own documentations I started to focus on the platform first.

## Platform Data

When it came to the platforms I knew that this specific aspect of the data probably wouldn't end up matching the first ranked game. Although the game that's at the very top Is on the Wii platform, as far as the sales go wii actually comes about 3rd in place of the highest. After doing some research, I found that the we actually came out in 2006 which is the year this year that this game is ranked. But it was not the most popular platform available. The wii is surpassed a little bit by the Xbox 360 and a lot by the playstation 2. These other two consoles were released prior to the wii. From what we can see with this part of the data. We can observe that the platform didn't necessarily have an effect as to why that game ranked number one.
